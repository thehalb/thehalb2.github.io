Can innovative team research and modern educational approaches sustainably improve collaboration in healthcare? Our work explores how new theoretical perspectives and training concepts can advance teamwork and learning in medical contexts.

Interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous education are key drivers of quality in healthcare. Our research investigates how teamwork can be promoted and enriched through diverse theoretical frameworks, and how medical education should move beyond mere competence to embrace a more holistic understanding of professionalism. We examine how contextual factors shape clinical reasoning and how targeted educational interventions can strengthen both team performance and individual decision-making. Our findings inform the development of innovative training strategies that foster effective collaboration and enhance clinical expertise, ultimately aiming to improve patient care.
