Can teamwork in medicine really reduce diagnostic errors—or does it sometimes make things worse? Our research uncovers the surprising conditions under which collaboration helps (or hinders) medical decision-making.

Effective teamwork plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis, influencing decision accuracy, collaboration quality, and overall patient outcomes. Our research explores the factors shaping diagnostic team performance, investigating when and why collaboration enhances decision-making. Through field studies, experimental designs, and survey research, we examine how factors such as case complexity, workload, professional hierarchies, and interprofessional stereotypes affect teamwork. Our findings reveal that collaboration often improves diagnostic accuracy by allowing team members to cross-check information and correct errors—though its benefits depend on the stage of the diagnostic process and the expertise of those involved. By understanding these dynamics, we aim to inform strategies for optimizing teamwork in medical settings, fostering better training approaches, and reducing diagnostic errors.
