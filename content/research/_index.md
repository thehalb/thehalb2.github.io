Incorrect medical diagnoses are unfortunately common, and some of them can have serious consequences for patients. However, there is limited understanding of the circumstances under which such errors occur and of how effective collaboration within the diagnostic team can help prevent them.

We are specifically interested in better understanding diagnosis as a team-based activity. For example, we investigate the interplay between cognitive and collaborative processes and how to best time team phases during the diagnostic process. To do this, we engage in continuous dialogue with practitioners to get input for our basic research and develop outputs (such as trainings) that are valuable for practice.

We rely on a wide array of methods, ranging from behavioral experiments, simulations, meta-analyses, and ethnography. We leverage theoretical approaches from a variety of disciplines and collaborate with an international interdisciplinary network.

Explore how our lab investigates the psychology of decision-making, collaboration, and clinical reasoning.
