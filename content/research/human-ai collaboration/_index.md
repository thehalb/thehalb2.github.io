What are the effects of integrating artificial intelligence into clinical decision-making? Our research explores how collaboration between humans and AI systems can shape diagnostic processes and outcomes in medical education and practice.

The integration of AI, particularly large language models, into healthcare is transforming the way clinicians approach diagnosis and decision-making. Our studies investigate the impact of AI-assisted coaching compared to traditional human coaching among medical students using patient vignettes. We aim to understand how interacting with AI systems influences diagnostic accuracy, learning processes, and clinical reasoning. By evaluating the benefits and limitations of human-AI collaboration, our research provides insights into optimizing the use of technology to support medical professionals and improve patient outcomes.
