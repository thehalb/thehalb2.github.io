abstract: 'The aim of this paper is to inspire team research to apply diverse and
  unconventional perspectives to study team dynamics and performance in healthcare
  settings. To illustrate that using multiple perspectives can yield valuable insights,
  we examine a segment of a team interaction during a heart-surgery, using five distinct
  interdisciplinary perspectives known from small group research: the psychodynamic,
  functional, conflict-power-status, temporal, and social identity perspectives. We
  briefly describe each theoretical perspective, discuss its application to study
  healthcare teams, and present possible research questions for the segment at hand
  using the respective perspective. We also highlight the benefits and challenges
  associated with employing these diverse approaches and explore how they can be integrated
  to analyze team processes in health care. Finally, we offer our own insights and
  opinions on the integration of these approaches, as well as the types of data required
  to conduct such analyses. We also point to further research avenues and highlight
  the benefits associated with employing these diverse approaches. Finally, we offer
  our own insights and opinions on the integration of these approaches, as well as
  the types of data required to conduct such analyses.'
