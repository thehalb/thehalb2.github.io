abstract: "Abstract  When making complex decisions, such as a medical diagnosis, decision
  makers typically gather, analyze, and synthesize (integrate) information. In a previous
  study, we showed that delegating such complex decisions to collaborating pairs increases
  decision quality substantially compared to that of individuals, without requiring
  different information gathering. Given the higher costs associated with teamwork,
  however, it is of great practical interest to understand when in the process the
  performance benefits of teams may arise, so that particular subtasks can be delegated
  to teams when most appropriate. We thus conducted an experimental study in which
  fourth‐year medical students ( n = 109) worked either in pairs or alone on two separate
  subtasks of the diagnostic process: (1) analyzing diagnostic test results (e.g.,
  X‐rays) and (2) integrating previously interpreted test results into diagnoses.
  Linear mixed‐effects models revealed a small benefit of collaborating pairs over
  individuals in both subtasks. We conclude that collaborating with a peer may pay
  off both when analyzing information and when integrating it into a diagnosis as
  it provides the opportunity to correct each other's errors and to make use of a
  greater knowledge base. These findings encourage the strategic use of collaboration
  with a colleague when making complex decisions. Further research into the underlying
  processes is needed."
